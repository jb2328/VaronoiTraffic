problem with date_shift() since it uses this.YEAR, this.MM, this.DD and hence is undefined

makien it a n object method is silly

hence the need make it DD/MM/YEAR globals


also perhaps it makes sense to have sctatterplot and other graphs as part of HUD object?
would have methods as HUD.toggle_line_grap(1)

problem with setting url as always sets to current day rather than 'today' -> makes it impossible to bookmark

I assume SITE_DB should stay global because it's used by differnt data grpahs but is it really? 

e.g drawLink is part of varonoi svg - accesses it to add arc lines

but drawLink is also used by scatter plot, so I can't use drawLink without with this.svg_canvas without also adding scatterPlot as a part voronoiViz



scatter plot is instantiated by the sacatter plot, and is referneced iteself as an argument

instantiate hud as a

separate objevt for ccontastant and make it static

same for globals like zell zones etc
