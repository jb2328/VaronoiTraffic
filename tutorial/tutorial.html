    <p>The visualisation displays Cambridge traffic data from a network of Bluetooth sensors deployed all around the
        city.</p>
    <p>The Bluetooth sensor network consists of 38 sensors that collect data on average traffic speed throughout
        Cambridge. </p>
    <p>This visualisation shows the data in real-time and displays how the current traffic speed deviates from the
        historical average in each of the 38 locations.</p>
    <h2>
        The Vocabulary
    </h2>
    <p>In order to better understand the visualisation, it is important to understand what we refer to when describing
        specific terms.</p>

    <h4>Colour Scheme</h4>
    <img src='./png/scale.png'></img>
    <p>In general, the colours in the visualisation represent the traffic speed deviation from what is considered to be
        the "normal". Hence, to illustrate such deviations, the sensor-allocated areas and Roads (reffered to as Links
        below) between sensors are coloured using a Red-Yellow-Green gradient. </p>
    <p>Throughout the visualisation, the red colour means that the traffic speed is slower than what is usually
        recorded, whereas green means that the traffic is faster. Yellow represents little to no deviation from the
        normal.</p>
    <h4>
        Links
    </h4>
    <p>
        Links are a simplified representation of the Cambridge road network. Every Link represents a Road between two
        Bluetooth sensors.
    </p>
    <p>Links are directional and are used throughout the visualisation to provide high granularity readings on the
        current state of traffic between any two sensors.</p>

    <p>Links colours represent the current traffic speed deviation, hence following the Colour Scheme, red Links have a
        slower than usual traffic speed, whereas green ones are faster.</p>
    <h4>
        Cells
    </h4>
    <p>We refer to Cells as coloured polygons you see on the screen, every Cell (or a polygon) represents the area that
        is covered by each of the 38 sensors.</p>

    <p>Just as with the Links, the Cell's colour represents the traffic intensity in the Cells surrounding area. The
        Cell's colour is calculated as the average of all the traffic crossing the Cell's boundary.</p>
    <h4>
        Zones
    </h4>
    <img src='./gif/zones.gif'></img>
    <p>We refer to Zones as a group of Cells. There are five Zones in total - North, South, East, West, and Center. </p>
    <p>Zone speeds are calculated by averaging Cell traffic speeds in a particular Zone. Zones speed comparison can be
        seen in bar chart on the right side of the screen. </p>
    <p> Users are able to interact with the graph and select the Zone they wish to inspect in more detail (refer to
        Interaction).</p>

    <h2>
        User Interaction
    </h2>
    <p>The subsection below provides an overview of how the users can interact with the visualisation.</p>

    <h3>
        Clicking on a Zone
    </h3>
    <img src='./png/zone.png'></img>

    <h3>
        Hovering over a Cell
    </h3>
    <img src='./png/hover.png'></img>
    <p>By hovering the mouse cursor over a Cell, the user is shown all in and out going Links from the Cell.</p>
    <p> The traffic flow direction for every Link is shown by animating the line arc representing a single Link.</p>
    <p>Upon hovering over a Cell, Cell's name appears that is derived from the real-world sensor location in Cambridge.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Clicking on a Cell
    </h3>
    <img src='./png/click.png'></img>
    <p>By clicking on a Cell users are able to inspect more specific information on the area in question.</p>
    <p>More information is immediately displayed, such as the line graph on the bottom left corner showing the
        historical data for all Links coming in and out of the Cell, as well as the ability to select the date for which
        the information is displayed.</p>

    <h3>
        Double-clicking on a Cell </h3>
    <p>Users have the option to double click on two Cells of their choice to show the fastest route between them.</p>
    <p> This can be done by double clicking on one Cell, and then double-clicking on another. This type of selection is
        differentiated from the normal (single-click) Cell selection by the dashed line surrounding the Cell's
        perimeter.</p>
    <h4>
        Finding the Fastest Route
    </h4>
    <img src='./gif/dijkstra.gif'></img>
    <p>The fastest route feature calculates the lowest travel time between the selected cell, and hence is not a result
        of
        the shortest distance, but rather time. As a result, the sequence in which the Cells are selected matters, as
        fastest route takes into account the direction in which the user intends to travel to.</p>

    <h3>
        Information Bar
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Information bar permits users to select what the visualisation displays. </p>

    <h4>Speed Deviation, Current Speed, and historical Speed</h4>
    <p>
        By default, the visualisation displays the speed deviation from average in the area surrounding the sensor.
        Users can alternatively select to see the current and historical speeds in all cells.
    </p>
    <img src='./gif/info.gif'></img>
    <h4>Display all Links</h4>
    <p>Alternatively, users can select to hide all Cells and just display the Links instead with their colour
        representing the speed deviation from the regular.</p>

    <h3>
        Modifying the URL
    </h3>
    <p>
        Upon clicking on a Cell, the website URL changes to represent the selection. Each of the 38 sensors has a unique
        id that is shown in the URL bar.
